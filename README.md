Portfolio Page

[Link](https://jessluff.github.io/portfolio-page)

This webpage is my professional portfolio.
The links in the navigation bar direct to sections of the webpage.
In future revisions, the 'work' links will direct to completed coding projects.
In the Contact Me section, email directs to send an email to myself, and Github directs to my Github profile.
